## üöÄ What is This Project?

**DocuInsight AI** is my personal attempt to build a smart document system ‚Äî something that reads PDFs or images, understands the content inside, and lets you query them in plain English.

I've been applying to companies like **Amazon** and **Google**, and I wanted to showcase more than just certifications ‚Äî this is my real-world project that blends cloud engineering and machine learning.

## üß† The Big Idea

> ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if I could just *drop a file* somewhere and then *ask questions* like:  
> _What is the total amount on that invoice from last month for Acme Corp?_‚Äù

That‚Äôs the goal. DocuInsight AI makes it possible by:

- Extracting text, forms, and tables using OCR.
- Generating embeddings (AI-understandable vectors).
- Storing all the data in smart search-friendly formats.
- Allowing natural language Q&A over documents via an API.
